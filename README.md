How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure I will employ a variety of software testing techniques to review, run, and confirm the expected results of the program with the actual results. This includes both static and dynamic testing techniques to ensure the program works as intended.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret and incorporate the user needs into a program by creating software requirements from the user stories and then design and test these requirements to make sure that the needs of the user are implemented correctly.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software with the mindset of a software tester. Making the software testable and ready to be tested will save time and money and will result in a higher quality software. I will limit bias in code and will remain diciplined in my commitment to quality.
